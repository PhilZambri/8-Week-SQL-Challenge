## Business Task
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

*I have loaded all the data for this case study into a local postgresql database.*  
*All of the data querying and transformations will be through this local database.*

## 🧼 Data Cleaning & Transformation
This case study contains 6 tables - `customer_orders`, `pizza_names`, `pizza_recipes`, `pizza_toppings`, `runner_orders`, and `runners`.

Let's get started!

### 🔨 Table: customer_orders
Starting with the `customer_orders` table, let's take a look at the data.
